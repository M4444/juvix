# Desugar

Desugaring consists of stripping away high-level constructs from the source.

This phase is the direct manipulation of the S-expression construct we left off of in the [previous section](./s-expression-syntax).

This function ([Desugar.op](https://github.com/anoma/juvix/blob/develop/library/Translate/src/Juvix/Desugar.hs))  desugars the frontend syntax from the original frontend s-exp representation to a form without modules, conditions, guards, etc. This pass thus does all transformations that do not requires a context.

The order of some these passes is relatively arbitrary.


## Desugaring S-expressions, Structurally

*Structurally* here refers to a systematic way of manipulating s-expressions in which a form has an equivalent Haskell ADT.

### Example

We'll use the example of the pass `let -> defun` to illustrate this transformation.
This code can be found in the [Structure](https://github.com/heliaxdev/juvix/blob/develop/library/Sexp/src/Juvix/Sexp/Structure) module.

```lisp
  ;; From S-expression Syntax
  (:defun foo (x)
    (:cond
      ((:infix == x 2) (:infix + 3 (:infix + 4 x)))
      (else            (:infix + x 2))))
```

`defun` is broken into the name `foo`, the arguments `x` and the body `cond`.

In [Structure/Frontend.hs](https://github.com/heliaxdev/juvix/blob/develop/library/Sexp/src/Juvix/Sexp/Structure/Frontend.hs) we find a Haskell encoding of this form:

```haskell
  -- | @Defun@ is the base defun structure
  -- currently it does not have matching
  data Defun = Defun
    { defunName :: Sexp.T,
      defunArgs :: Sexp.T,
      defunBody :: Sexp.T
    }
    deriving (Show)
```

```{note}
Notice how we say nothing about the head being the `cadr` of the structure, and the arguments the `caddr`, and the body of course the `caddr`. Instead, we just lay out the logical structures in a record, divorced from any representation.
```

We provide an API to deal with the actual representation.

```haskell
  ----------------------------------------
  -- Defun
  ----------------------------------------

  nameDefun :: NameSymbol.T
  nameDefun = ":defun"

  isDefun :: Sexp.T -> Bool
  isDefun (Sexp.Cons form _) = Sexp.isAtomNamed form nameDefun
  isDefun _ = False

  toDefun :: Sexp.T -> Maybe Defun
  toDefun form
    | isDefun form =
      case form of
        _Defun Sexp.:> sexp1 Sexp.:> sexp2 Sexp.:> sexp3 Sexp.:> Sexp.Nil ->
          Defun sexp1 sexp2 sexp3 |> Just
        _ ->
          Nothing
    | otherwise =
      Nothing

  fromDefun :: Defun -> Sexp.T
  fromDefun (Defun sexp1 sexp2 sexp3) =
    Sexp.list [Sexp.atom nameDefun, sexp1, sexp2, sexp3]
```

All records in that file have a corresponding interface
of `name<structure>`, `is<structure>`, `to<strcuture>`, and
`from<structure>`. These deal with the small details of `cars` and
`cdrs`.

This transformation can be tested by opening the [Easy file](https://github.com/heliaxdev/juvix/blob/develop/library/Playground/Easy/src/Easy.hs) in the Juvix
REPL and running

```haskell
  λ> Right defun = Sexp.parse "(:defun foo (x) (:cond ((:infix == x 2) (:infix + 3 (:infix + 4 x))) (else (:infix + x 2))))"
  λ> import qualified Juvix.Sexp.Structure as Structure
  λ> Structure.toDefun defun
  Just (Defun {defunName = "foo", defunArgs = ("x"), defunBody = (":cond" ((":infix" "==" "x" 2) (":infix" "+" 3 (":infix" "+" 4 "x"))) ("else" (":infix" "+" "x" 2)))})
```

What this buys us, is that when it comes time to do the passes, we
don't have to worry about these details, while trying to make sure we
don't change the semantics of the passes themselves. This properly
decouples our concerns so we can worry about the abstraction meaning
of the syntax in the passes while worrying about the details here.

[The lisp haskell generator](https://github.com/anomanetwork/juvix/blob/develop/library/Sexp/src/Juvix/Sexp/Structure/generator.lisp#L266) was
created to reduce the amount of boilerplate.

Here are some choice snippets that cover every case of the generator

```lisp
  ;; 1
  (generate-haskell "Defun" '("sexp" "sexp" "sexp") ":defun")

  ;; 2
  (generate-haskell "ArgBody" '("sexp" "sexp") nil)

  ;; 3
  (generate-haskell "DeconBody" (repeat 2 "sexp") nil)

  (generate-haskell "Case" '("sexp" "deconBody") "case" :list-star t)


  ;; 4
  (generate-haskell "NotPunned" '("sexp" "sexp") nil)

  (generate-haskell "RecordNoPunned" '("notPunnedGroup") ":record-no-pun"
                    :list-star t
                    :un-grouped t)

  ;; 5
  (generate-haskell "ArgBody" '("sexp" "sexp") nil)
  ;; bodys here, as there are multiple!
  (generate-haskell "LetMatch" '("sexp" "argBodys" "sexp") ":let-match")
```
1. The first one correlates to the structure we've already seen. Namely
   the `Defun` struct. the first argument is the type name we wish to
   generate. This is of course `Defun`. the second argument is the
   list we wish to parse, in this case it says all three arguments are
   just `Sexp.T`'s. and binds them in order to `name`, `args`, and
   `body` in the struct itself. The third argument is the name of the
   structure itself if it has one. Our lets are translated to the
   :defun structure, and so we note that here.

2. The second case correlates to a very similar structure, except for
   that it lacks a name. so the structure we care about is `(arg
   body)` with no name attached. The `nil` in the third argument
   reflects this change.

3. the third case correlates to a scenario with two changes. The first
   being is that we can define types for another to rely on. Here we
   are saying that case has the type `DecondBody`, we use lower case
   to reflect the proper variable name this associates with. Further
   the `:list-start t` aspect of this tells us that the last argument,
   in this case of `DeconBody`, is the rest of the s-expression and
   not just the `cadr`.
   ```haskell
     data Case = Case
       { caseOn :: Sexp.T,
         caseImplications :: [DeconBody]
       }
       deriving (Show)
   ```

4. The fourth is the last new concept of the bunch, namely we have
   `:un-grouped t`, which states the form in which this parses are not
   grouped like

   `((name₁ type₁) (name₂ type₂) … (nameₙ typeₙ))`, but rather

   `(name₁ type₁ name₂ type₂ … nameₙ typeₙ)`.

  This means that we have to tell it explicitly that it occurs over 2
   positions with that `:un-grouped` argument.

5. The fifth case is an interesting one. The key insight is that we
   say `argBodys` rather than `argBody`. This is because our generator
   is limited. Thus we manually write

   ```haskell
     -- these are ungrouned fromArgBodys, where we groupBy2 both ways
     fromArgBodys :: [ArgBody] -> Sexp.T
     fromArgBodys = Sexp.unGroupBy2 . toStarList fromArgBody

     -- these are ungrouned fromArgBodys, where we groupBy2 both ways
     toArgBodys :: Sexp.T -> Maybe [ArgBody]
     toArgBodys = fromStarList toArgBody . Sexp.groupBy2
   ```

   To be able to handle the scenario where the list-star like form
   happens in not the last argument, but rather in a list in some
   other position!

### Improvements Upon the Generator

The generator can be improved a lot, as the previous section mentions
it was hacked together using string interpolation which is not a good
structural way to handle this sort of problem. The alternative would
however take a week of hacking, so it is not a priority to undergo.

However there are two worthwhile hacks that we should undergo.

1. Change the `Maybe` of the `to<Name>` to an `Either`.

   This change at the current moment does not matter. Namely because
   `Nothing` should never be triggered. It would be great, thought, if the
   generated code could instead generate an `Either` where the left
   counts the number of arguments given and states precisely why it
   can't translate the given S-expression form into the type we want.

2. list-star like behavior anywhere. Currently we bake it into the
   last form, but it would be nice if we could have a way to denote
   this for the middle slots, so we can avoid hacks, like the manual
   `argBodys` example given in the last section.


## Desugaring Passes

Now that we understand the structural underpinnings of the pass, we
can now talk about the transformation itself.

We can observe the passes [here](https://github.com/heliaxdev/juvix/blob/develop/library/Translate/src/Juvix/Desugar/Passes.hs#L32).

The most important detail to note is that if you have a clear view of
the input and output of pass, a pass should be easy to write and
review. If creating this is hard, then I suggest reading through the
next section to see the full life cycle of this process.

### Creating a Pass

Instead of just showing an example, let us show writing one. Let us
define the `cond` transformation. We can find the form [here](./s-expression-syntax).

It seems the `Cond` form is filled with a bunch of `((:infix ≡≡ x 3) 1)`
forms which we can abstractly view as `(<pred> <ans>)`. So let us
define these forms as a type. We do this in [the `Structure` folder](https://github.com/anomanetwork/juvix/tree/develop/library/Sexp/src/Juvix/Sexp/Structure). In
particular we want to put this in [Structure/Frontend.hs](https://github.com/anomanetwork/juvix/blob/develop/library/Sexp/src/Juvix/Sexp/Structure/Frontend.hs#L66) since this shows up in
the frontend syntax.

```haskell
  -- | @PredAns@ is an abstraction over questions and answers
  data PredAns = PredAns {predAnsPredicate :: Sexp.T, predAnsAnswer :: Sexp.T}
    deriving (Show)

  -- | @Cond@ here Cond form takes a list of predicate answers
  newtype Cond = Cond {condEntailments :: [PredAns]} deriving (Show)
```

To reflect the structure we include the raw forms in the [generator
file](https://github.com/anomanetwork/juvix/blob/develop/library/Sexp/src/Juvix/Sexp/Structure/generator.lisp#L281) and take the output of these calls into the Structure file.

```lisp
  (generate-haskell "PredAns" (repeat 2 "sexp") nil)

  (generate-haskell "Cond" '("predAns") ":cond" :list-star t)
```

Now we can test that we successfully matched the BNF by using the REPL

```haskell
  λ> Right cond = Sexp.parse "(:cond ((:infix == x 2) (:infix + 3 (:infix + 4 x))) (else (:infix + x 2)))"
  λ> Structure.toCond cond
  Just
    (Cond
       {condEntailments =
          [PredAns { predAnsPredicate = (":infix" "==" "x" 2)
                   , predAnsAnswer = (":infix" "+" 3 (":infix" "+" 4 "x"))}
          ,PredAns { predAnsPredicate = "else"
                   , predAnsAnswer = (":infix" "+" "x" 2)}]})
```


Now we know the shape of the data we are working with!

To get closer to the core version of match, let us first desugar this
to an if. Something like

`(:Cond (pred-1 result-1) … (pred-n result-n))` should turn into

`(if pred-1 result-1 (if pred-2 result-2 (… (if pred-n result-n))))`

So like cond, we also also define the records and forms we wish to
work on

```haskell
  -- | @If@ has an pred, then, and else.
  data If = If
    { ifPredicate :: Sexp.T,
      ifConclusion :: Sexp.T,
      ifAlternative :: Sexp.T
    }
    deriving (Show)

  -- | @IfNoElse@ has a pred and a then.
  data IfNoElse = IfNoElse
    { ifNoElsePredicate :: Sexp.T,
      ifNoElseConclusion :: Sexp.T
    }
    deriving (Show)


  -- In the generator
  (generate-haskell "If" (repeat 3 "sexp") "if")
  (generate-haskell "IfNoElse" (repeat 2 "sexp") "if")
```

Because our generator is limited we make two variants.

Now let us write the form, first let us observe that we can view this
operation from `cond` to `if` as folding `if` over the list of
`PredAns`, with the result being an if with no else condition.

```haskell

  condToIf condExpression
      | Just cond <- Structure.toCond condExpression,
        -- we need to setup the if with no else
        Just last <- lastMay (cond ^. entailments) =
        let acc =
              -- let's create it, with the predicate and answer of the
              -- PredAns tye
              Structure.IfNoElse (last ^. predicate) (last ^. answer)
                |> Structure.fromIfNoElse
         -- Now let us employ the fold strategy we talked about
         in foldr generation acc (initSafe (cond ^. entailments))
      | otherwise = error "malformed cond"
    where
      -- this is the folded function, see how we just build up the if,
      -- then push it back to an s-expression at the end?
      generation predAns acc =
        Structure.If (predAns ^. predicate) (predAns ^. answer) acc
          |> Structure.fromIf
```

With our current understanding we'd write something like this, and in
fact we can test it as is! Just go to the [Easy Pipeline file](https://github.com/heliaxdev/juvix/blob/develop/library/Playground/Easy/Pipeline/src/Easy.hs#L139) and
include these dependencies and the function above.

```haskell
  import qualified Juvix.Sexp.Structure as Structure
  import Juvix.Sexp.Structure.Lens
  import Control.Lens hiding ((|>))
```

Along with the definition and now we can see

```haskell
  λ> Right cond = Sexp.parse "(:cond ((:infix == x 2) (:infix + 3 (:infix + 4 x))) (else (:infix + x 2)))"

  λ> condToIf cond
  ("if" (":infix" "==" "x" 2) (":infix" "+" 3 (":infix" "+" 4 "x")) ("if" "else" (":infix" "+" "x" 2)))
```

### Reviewing a Pass

The following code can be found [here](https://github.com/heliaxdev/juvix/blob/develop/library/Translate/src/Juvix/Desugar/Passes.hs#L32).

```haskell
  -- | @condTransform@ - CondTransform turns the cond form of the fronted
  -- language into a series of ifs
  -- - BNF input form:
  --   + (:Cond (pred-1 result-1) … (pred-n result-n))
  -- - BNF output form:
  --   + (if pred-1 result-1 (if pred-2 result-2 (… (if pred-n result-n))))
  condTransform :: Sexp.T -> Sexp.T
  condTransform xs = Sexp.foldPred xs (== Structure.nameCond) condToIf
    where
      condToIf atom cdr
        | Just cond <- Structure.toCond (Sexp.Atom atom Sexp.:> cdr),
          Just last <- lastMay (cond ^. entailments) =
          let acc =
                Structure.IfNoElse (last ^. predicate) (last ^. answer)
                  |> Structure.fromIfNoElse
           in foldr generation acc (initSafe (cond ^. entailments))
                |> Sexp.addMetaToCar atom
        | otherwise = error "malformed cond"
      --
      generation predAns acc =
        Structure.If (predAns ^. predicate) (predAns ^. answer) acc
          |> Structure.fromIf
```

We saw most of this form in the creation of a pass section
above. However we will go over the rough strategy briefly. In order to
turn the input of `cond` to an `if`, we can view it as a fold, where
we fold the `if` form over the predicate and answers of the `cond`
structure with the accumulator being the already built up if's. We can
see this by the `BNF` comment at the start of the function. This
transformation gets us closer to the more primitive `match`
representation that is present in core.

We can see the implementation of this strategy shine through in the
body of `condToIf` and the folded function `generation`.

The main difference from our creation of a pass section is that we
have this `Sexp.foldPred` call, and that `condToIf` has two
arguments. The impotence of this is that `Sexp.foldPred` searches the
entire S-expression structure for the name `Structure.nameCond`, which
is `:cond`. When it sees this function it breaks the structure into
the `atom`, `:cond`, and the `cdr` which is the rest of the
structure. This means that if you run this on any form that contains
the `cond` form, then it will automatically run this transformation
for you!

The last key bit of information is `Sexp.addMetaToCar atom`, this is
to preserve meta information like line-numbers that were on the
`:cond` atom that we would like on our newly generated `if` atom.

Overall, reviewing a pass is rather easy, just keep in mind what the
input form is, and what the output form is. As long as the output form
is getting closer to the Core representation of matters, we have a
successful pass.

To verify this pass, we can easily run it for ourselves and see if the
`BNF` comment is being truthful.

```haskell
  λ> Pass.condTransform cond

  λ> Right cond = Sexp.parse "(:defun f (x) (:cond ((:infix == x 2) (:infix + 3 (:infix + 4 x))) (else (:infix + x 2))))"
  λ> cond
