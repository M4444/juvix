-- Folding Capabilities
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- | @foldSearchPred@ is like @foldPred@ with some notable exceptions.
-- 1. Instead of recusing on the @predChange@ form, it will just leave
--    the main form in tact.
--    - This is because in this sort of task we
--      will wish to maybe just change an aspect of it but maybe not
--      the actual form!
-- 2. We have a @predBind@ predicate which allows us to tell it what
--    forms can cause binders. This is useful when we care about what
--    is in scope for doing certain changes.
--
-- 3. In the case where both predicates match, then we will run the
--    binder and then the actual transformation, this is to ensure the
--    lexical semantics are respected, and then we can cleanup after
--    this.
--
-- 4. If the @predChange@ function accepts ":atom", then the function
--    will also be ran on the atom
--
-- For arguments, this function takes a Sexp, along with 2 sets of
-- pred function pairs. The function for the binding we take a
-- continuation, as it's not easy to automate the recursive calls in
-- instances such as case, so we have to do it by hand for those
-- binder cases

-- | @foldPred@ searches the sexp structure given to it with a given
-- predicate. This predicate is ran on the @car@ of every list
-- structure. This simulates searches for the head of a function
-- call. When the predicate returns true, the function passed to
-- foldPred (which we shall refer to as f), is then called on the
-- @car@, and the @cdr@ of the list, giving back a new sexp
-- structure. This new sexp structure is then recursed upon by
-- foldPred. NOTE that this does mean the structure handed back by f.
foldPred :: B a -> (NameSymbol.T -> Bool) -> (Atom a -> B a -> B a) -> B a

-- | @map@ works the same as it does in Haskell. However instead of
-- running it on the generic of the Sexp, it instead runs it on the
-- elements on the Sexp structure itself.
map :: (B a -> B b) -> B a -> B b
map f = foldr (Cons . f) Nil

-- General Functionality

-- | @butLast@ takes a list and removes the last element of the list,
-- if handed an atom, it will return the atom
butLast :: B a -> B a
butLast (Cons _ Nil) = Nil
butLast (Cons x xs) = Cons x (butLast xs)
butLast (Atom a) = Atom a
butLast Nil = Nil

-- | @last@ gives back the last element of the list, for an atom or nil
-- it will be the identity
last :: B a -> B a
last (Cons x Nil) = x
last (Cons _ xs) = last xs
last (Atom a) = Atom a
last Nil = Nil

-- | @init@ gives back the list back minus the last element, for an atom or nil
-- it will be the identity
init :: B a -> B a
init (Cons _ Nil) = Nil
init (Cons x xs) = Cons x (init xs)
init (Atom a) = Atom a
init Nil = Nil

-- | @list@ takes a foldable structure of Sexps and gives back a list of
-- those structures
list :: Foldable t => t (B a) -> B a
list = Std.foldr Cons Nil

-- | @listStar@ is a lot like @list@, but, it will automatically @Cons@
-- into the last structure
-- Example:
-- >>> listStar [atom "list", atom "a", atom "b", list [atom "c", atom "d"]]
-- ("list" "a" "b" "c" "d")
listStar :: [B a] -> B a
listStar = fromMaybe Nil . foldr1May Cons

-- | @addMetaToCar@ moves the meta information from a given atom into
-- the car of the given sexpression. If it's not a @Cons@ then it is
-- ignored.
addMetaToCar :: Atom a -> B a -> B a
addMetaToCar (A _ lineInfo) (Cons (Atom (A term _)) xs) =
  Cons (Atom (A term lineInfo)) xs
addMetaToCar _ xs = xs

-- | @car@ grabs the head of the list
car :: B a -> B a
car (Cons x _) = x
car Nil = Nil
car (Atom a) = Atom a

-- | @cdr@ grabs the tail of the list
cdr :: B a -> B a
cdr (Cons _ xs) = xs
cdr Nil = Nil
cdr (Atom a) = Atom a

-- | @cadr@ grabs the second element of the list
cadr :: B a -> B a
cadr = car . cdr

-- | @atom@ creates a @Sexp@ @Atom@ from a @NameSymbol.T@
atom :: NameSymbol.T -> B a
atom x = Atom $ A x Nothing

-- | @actualAtom@ creates an @Atom@ from a @NameSymbol.T@
actualAtom :: NameSymbol.T -> Atom a
actualAtom x = A x Nothing

suffixAtom :: NameSymbol.T -> B a -> B a
suffixAtom name (Atom (A name' cdr)) = (Atom (A (NameSymbol.append name' name) cdr))
suffixAtom _ sexp = sexp

-- | @number@ creates a @Sexp@ @Number@ from an @Integer@
number :: Integer -> B a
number n = Atom $ N n Nothing

-- | @double@ creates a @Sexp@ @Double@ from a @Double@
double :: Double -> B a
double d = Atom $ D d Nothing

-- | @string@ creates a @Sexp@ @String@ from a @Text@
string :: Text -> B a
string t = Atom $ S t Nothing

-- | @isAtomNamed@ asks if an atom is named a particular name. Cons and
-- Nil both return False
isAtomNamed :: B a -> NameSymbol.T -> Bool
isAtomNamed (Atom (A name _)) name2 = name == name2
isAtomNamed _ _ = False

-- | @atomFromT@ returns the Atom from the list, will returning
-- @Nothing@ if it is not an @Atom@
atomFromT :: B a -> Maybe (Atom a)
atomFromT (Atom a) = Just a
atomFromT _ = Nothing

-- | @nameFromT@ is similar to @atomFromT@ but it grabs the
-- @NameSymbol.T@ out of the @Atom@
nameFromT :: B a -> Maybe NameSymbol.T
nameFromT (Atom (A name _)) = Just name
nameFromT _ = Nothing

-- | @doubleFromT@ is similar to @atomFromT@ but it grabs the
-- @dobule@ out of the @Atom@
doubleFromT :: B a -> Maybe Double
doubleFromT (Atom (D d _)) = Just d
doubleFromT _ = Nothing

-- | @stringFromT@ is similar to @atomFromT@ but it grabs the
-- @string@ out of the @Atom@
stringFromT :: B a -> Maybe Text
stringFromT (Atom (S s _)) = Just s
stringFromT _ = Nothing

-- | @assoc@ takes two sexps. First being a sexp that is to be found in
-- the second argument. The other is a sexp list that is grouped into
-- twos. If the search for element is found in the grouped list, then
-- the second element of that sexp is returned. Otherwise @Nothing@ is
-- returned.
-- Example:
-- >>> fmap (assoc (number 2)) (parse "((1 a) (2 b) (3 c))")
-- Right (Just "b")
assoc :: Eq a => B a -> B a -> Maybe (B a)
assoc t xs = cadr <$> findKey car t xs

-- | @groupBy2@ groups the given sexp structure into pairs. If the list
-- is not even, then the last element is dropped.
-- Example
-- >>> fmap groupBy2 (parse "(1 a 2 b 3 c)")
-- Right ((1 "a") (2 "b") (3 "c"))
groupBy2 :: B a -> B a
groupBy2 (a1 :> a2 :> rest) =
  list [a1, a2] :> groupBy2 rest
groupBy2 _ = Nil

-- | @unGroupBy2@ does the opposite of @groupBy2@. If the given list is
-- even then
-- @unGroupBy2 . groupBy2 = idl@ âˆ§ @groupBy2 .  unGroupBy2 = idr@
unGroupBy2 :: B a -> B a
unGroupBy2 (List [a1, a2] :> rest) =
  a1 :> a2 :> unGroupBy2 rest
unGroupBy2 (a :> rest) =
  a :> unGroupBy2 rest
unGroupBy2 a = a

-- | @snoc@ is cons but backwards. Thus it conses on the end of a given list
snoc :: B a -> B a -> B a
snoc e (Cons x y) = Cons x (snoc e y)
snoc e a@(Atom _) = Cons a e
snoc e Nil = e

-- | @findKey searches a Sexpression structure for a particular
-- structure. the given key allows us to zoom in on a particular subset
-- of that structure.
-- >>> fmap (findKey car (number 2)) (parse "((1 a) (2 b) (3 c))")
-- Right (Just (2 "b"))
findKey :: Eq a => (B a -> B a) -> B a -> B a -> Maybe (B a)
findKey f k (x :> xs)
  | f x == k = Just x
  | otherwise = findKey f k xs
findKey _ _ _ = Nothing

-- | @flatten@ totally flattens a list, removing any extra Nils as well
-- >>> fmap flatten (parse "((1) (2 3 4) (1 2) () (1 2 (3 ())))")
-- Right (1 2 3 4 1 2 1 2 3)
flatten :: B a -> B a
flatten xs = rec xs Nil
  where
    rec Nil acc = acc
    rec (Atom a) acc = Cons (Atom a) acc
    rec (Cons x xs) acc = rec x (rec xs acc)
